## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Solid Mathematical Foundation
-   **Proprietary Calculation Model:** Uses a unique mathematical core that serves as a dynamic central reference point.
-   **Volatility-Adaptive Scaling:** Employs the asset's inherent volatility as the primary scalar, ensuring automatic adaptation across different instruments.
-   **Geometric Structure:** Incorporates Fibonacci-inspired geometric proportions to define support and resistance level structures with mathematical precision.

### 2. 9-Level Trading System (Price Ranges)
The indicator defines nine critical levels that form a complete framework for market analysis:

| Level | Name | Type | Description |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|
| **a** | **Buying Exhaustion ‚Äì Upper Bound (Ceiling)** | `Solid Red Line` | Zone where buying pressure is exhausted; signals potential reversal or distribution. |
| **b** | **Impulse Validation Level (Buy-side)** | `Solid Magenta Line` | Critical point validating the strength of a bullish impulse after a climax. |
| **c** | **Midpoint Validation Level / Equilibrium Point (50%)** | `Dash-Dot White Line` | Intermediate equilibrium level acting as dynamic support/resistance. |
| **d** | **Pullback Zone (Buy-side) / Demand Origin** | `Solid Gray Line` | Base of the bullish movement; origin of demand and last defense of buyers. |
| **e** | **General Mean Level / Central Equilibrium** | `Dashed Blue Line` | **The structural axis.** The theoretical global balance point of the indicator. |
| **f** | **Throwback Zone (Sell-side) / Supply Origin** | `Solid Gray Line` | Base of the bearish movement; origin of supply and last defense of sellers. |
| **g** | **Midpoint Validation Level (Sell-side) / Bearish Equilibrium (50%)** | `Dash-Dot White Line` | Intermediate point of the bearish trajectory. |
| **h** | **Impulse Validation Level (Sell-side) / Test Level** | `Solid Magenta Line` | Level confirming or invalidating the bearish impulse after a bottom. |
| **i** | **Selling Exhaustion ‚Äì Lower Bound (Floor)** | `Solid Red Line` | Zone where selling pressure is exhausted; signals a bearish climax. |

### 3. Capital Flow Algorithm
-   **Tick-by-Tick Analysis:** Processes volume data at the tick level to detect the market's real intent, filtering out noise from mere price action.
-   **Intent Detection:** Distinguishes between genuine accumulation/distribution and false market moves.

### 4. Technical Implementation
-   **Language:** Developed in **MQL5** for superior performance and integration with MetaTrader 5.
-   **Optimization:** Coded for maximum efficiency, ensuring minimal latency even on lower-spec machines.

### 5. Compatibility
-   **Universal Application:** Compatible with all financial instruments including Forex, Stocks, Indices, Commodities, and Cryptocurrencies.
-   **Timeframe Agnostic:** Works seamlessly on any timeframe (M1 to MN) without requiring manual reconfiguration.

## üìä Interpretation Guide

-   **Price above Central Equilibrium (Blue Line):** Suggests a bullish bias. Look for reactions at the buy-side levels (a-d).
-   **Price below Central Equilibrium (Blue Line):** Suggests a bearish bias. Look for reactions at the sell-side levels (f-i).
-   **Rejection at Exhaustion Levels (Red Lines):** A strong signal for a potential reversal.
-   **Hold of Demand/Supply Origin (Gray Lines):** Indicates the ongoing strength of the current trend.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

**EndFlow Momentum** is a sophisticated decision-support tool designed to give you an edge in market analysis. It does not, however, guarantee trading results. The indicator must be used as part of a comprehensive trading strategy that includes **proper risk management.** Always backtest and forward-test any strategy before deploying live capital.
