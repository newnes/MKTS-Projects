# üéØ Welcome, Patrick Nill

It is a genuine honor for me that you have access to **EndFlow Momentum (EFM)**. As an admirer of your trajectory and competitive mindset, I have developed this tool with the same rigor and pursuit of excellence that characterizes a World Trading Champion.

## ‚ö° What is EndFlow Momentum

EFM is not just another indicator. It is the result of years of research dedicated to solving a crucial question: **how to detect the market's true intention through capital flow?**

The answer materializes in a dual-signal system and a 9-level structure that acts as a **geometric "force field"**, revealing accumulation, distribution, and exhaustion zones that are typically invisible in raw price action.

## üöÄ Immediate Access

The `EndFlow_Momentum_Nill.ex5` file is ready to be installed in your MetaTrader 5. I have disabled any licensing or expiration systems as a demonstration of transparency and confidence in the tool's value.

**Installation (2 steps):**
1.  Copy the `.ex5` file to your `MQL5/Indicators` folder.
2.  Restart MT5. The indicator will be ready to use on any chart.

## üìñ Complete Documentation

All technical foundations, signal interpretation manual, and backtesting examples are available in the main repository:
[Quantitative Research Lab](https://github.com/newnes/MKTS-Projects/tree/master/EndFlow_Momentum_Studio)

I particularly recommend the `Technical_Specs.md` to understand the logic behind the 9 levels.

## üíé One Final Thought

I suspect your analytical mind will immediately appreciate EFM's potential, not just for trading, but for **confirming or invalidating trading ideas** from a completely different and complementary analytical angle.

## ü§ù Appreciation

Thank you for your time and consideration. Your opinion, if and when you have a moment to explore EFM, would be invaluable to me.

Please don't hesitate to write if you have any questions.

**Sincerely,**
