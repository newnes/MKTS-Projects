## 🔍 The 6 EFM Quadrants: Reading Market Intent

EFM’s strength lies in interpreting the relationship between its two primary signals and the central equilibrium.  
This creates **six distinct market scenarios**:

| Quadrant | Condition        | Narrative                                         | Trading Bias        |
|:--------:|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------|:-------------------|
| **1 – Bullish Momentum**    | `IF > CM > CE` | Strong, sustained buying pressure            | 🟢 **Strong Buy** |
| **2 – Bullish Correction**  | `CM > IF > CE` | Healthy pullback within an uptrend           | 🟡 **Buy on Dips** |
| **3 – Bearish Momentum**    | `IF < CM < CE` | Strong, sustained selling pressure           | 🔴 **Strong Sell** |
| **4 – Bearish Correction**  | `CM < IF < CE` | Healthy bounce within a downtrend            | 🟠 **Sell on Rallies** |
| **5 – Bull Trap / Accumulation** | `IF < CE < CM` | False breakdown. Weak price, smart money accumulating | ⚪ **Buying Opportunity** |
| **6 – Bear Trap / Distribution** | `IF > CE > CM` | False breakout. Strong price, smart money distributing | ⚫ **Selling Opportunity** |

> **Legend:**  
> IF = *Instant Flow* · CM = *Cumulative Momentum* · CE = *Central Equilibrium*
